Nesbit\n\n\n\n\n     “It may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be\n     collected a system of civil and economical prudence.  He has\n     been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be\n     doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of\n     theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence\n     can be collected than he alone has given to his country.”--\n     Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\n\nThe writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed “the richest, the\npurest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.”\n\nShakespeare instructed by delighting. His plays alone (leaving mere\nscience out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the\nwhole body of English learning. He is the teacher of all good-- pity,\ngenerosity, true courage, love. His bright wit is cut out “into little\nstars.” His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and\nproverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the\nEnglish-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage\nwhich he does not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though\noften unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his friend, Ben Jonson,\nwrote of him, “He was not of an age but for all time.” He ever kept the\nhighroad of human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths\nof feeling and sentiment. In his creations we have no moral highwaymen,\nsentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant\nadventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in which\nthe grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the\nsuperficial attraction of style and sentiment. He flattered no bad\npassion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just\nand generous principle. While causing us to laugh at folly, and shudder\nat crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and our\nreverence for ourselves.\n\nShakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with\nall that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of\nthat indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and\nclear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland\nsolitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of\npoetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to\nmental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in\nthe midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of\nsunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or\nrepulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter\nelements.\n\nThese things considered, what wonder is it that the works of\nShakespeare, next to the Bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the\nclassics of English literature. “So extensively have the characters of\nShakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,”\n says an American author,--“So interwoven are these characters in the\ngreat body of English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of\nthese dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.”\n\nBut Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in\nwords that little folks cannot understand.\n\nHence this volume. To reproduce the entertaining stories contained\nin the plays of Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can\nunderstand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of\nthese Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare.\n\nAnd that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing any\nunfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has prepared\nand included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of Difficult Names.\nTo which is added a collection of Shakespearean Quotations, classified\nin alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the\nworld's greatest dramatist.\n\nE. T. R.\n\n\n\n\nA BRIEF LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.\n\n\n\nIn the register of baptisms of the parish church of Stratford-upon-Avon,\na market town in Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April 26,\n1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the son of John Shakspeare.\nThe entry is in Latin--“Gulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.”\n\nThe date of William Shakespeare's birth has usually been taken as three\ndays before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this\nfact.\n\nThe family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always\nspelling it in the same way. While in the baptismal record the name is\nspelled “Shakspeare,” in several authentic autographs of the dramatist\nit reads “Shakspere,” and in the first edition of his works it is\nprinted “Shakespeare.”\n\nHalliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways in\nwhich the various members of the Shakespeare family wrote the name,\nand in the council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is\nintroduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that\nthe dramatist's father was a member of the municipal body, there are\nfourteen different spellings. The modern “Shakespeare” is not among\nthem.\n\nShakespeare's father, while an alderman at Stratford, appears to have\nbeen unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of\nten were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is not\nspecially to his discredit."
var ShakespearePart2 = "\n\nThe traditions and other sources of information about the occupation\nof Shakespeare's father differ. He is described as a butcher, a\nwoolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may have\nbeen all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that if\nhe could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of his\noccupation was such as to make it easy to understand how the various\ntraditions sprang up. He was a landed proprietor and cultivator of his\nown land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, who\nwas Mary Arden, daughter of a country gentleman, the estate of Asbies,\n56 acres in extent. William was the third child. The two older than he\nwere daughters, and both probably died in infancy. After him was born\nthree sons and a daughter. For ten or twelve years at least, after\nShakespeare's birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances. In\nthe year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of Stratford,\nand for many years afterwards he held the position of alderman as he\nhad done for three years before. To the completion of his tenth year,\ntherefore, it is natural to suppose that William Shakespeare would get\nthe best education that Stratford could afford. The free school of the\ntown was open to all boys and like all the grammar-schools of that time,\nwas under the direction of men who, as graduates of the universities,\nwere qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once the\nboast of England. There is no record of Shakespeare's having been at\nthis school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educated\nthere. His father could not have procured for him a better education\nanywhere. To those who have studied Shakespeare's works without being\ninfluenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a very\nnarrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have been\nsolidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught in the\ngrammar schools.\n\nThere are local associations connected with Stratford which could not\nbe without their influence in the formation of young Shakespeare's mind.\nWithin the range of such a boy's curiosity were the fine old historic\ntowns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the\ngrand monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon abounded with spots of\nsingular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut\nout from the general world, as many country towns are. It was a great\nhighway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its\nmarkets. The eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for\nobservation. But nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his\nbirth to his marriage to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date\nnothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor in\nLondon about 1589.\n\nHow long acting continued to be Shakespeare's sole profession we have\nno means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very\nsoon after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which\nhe is known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter\nolder plays not up to the standard that was required at the time was\na common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, and\nShakespeare's abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted\nfor this kind of work. When the alterations in plays originally composed\nby other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation would\nbecome in reality a work of creation. And this is exactly what we have\nexamples of in a few of Shakespeare's early works, which are known to\nhave been founded on older plays.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world's\ngreatest dramatist. Criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the\nfinest minds of England, Germany, and America have devoted their powers\nto an elucidation of their worth.\n\nShakespeare died at Stratford on the 23rd of April, 1616. His father had\ndied before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. His wife survived\nhim till August, 1623. His so Hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven\nyears. His two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, Susanna, had,\nin 1607, married a physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of\nthis marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first\nThomas Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by\neither marriage. Shakespeare's younger daughter, Judith, on the 10th of\nFebruary, 1616, married a Stratford gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by\nwhom she had three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue. There\nare thus no direct descendants of Shakespeare.\n\nShakespeare's fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew him\nin other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius,\nbut their respect and love for the man. Ben Jonson said, “I love the\nman, and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. He\nwas indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.” He was buried on\nthe second day after his death, on the north side of the chancel\nof Stratford church. Over his grave there is a flat stone with this\ninscription, said to have been written by himself:\n\n    Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare\n    To digg the dust encloased heare:\n    Blest be ye man yt spares these stones,\n    And curst be he yt moves my bones.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n"
var ShakespearePart3 = "A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM\n\n\n\nHermia and Lysander were lovers; but Hermia's father wished her to marry\nanother man, named Demetrius.\n\nNow, in Athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which any\ngirl who refused to marry according to her father's wishes, might be put\nto death. Hermia's father was so angry with her for refusing to do as\nhe wished, that he actually brought her before the Duke of Athens to\nask that she might be killed, if she still refused to obey him. The Duke\ngave her four days to think about it, and, at the end of that time, if\nshe still refused to marry Demetrius, she would have to die.\n\nLysander of course was nearly mad with grief, and the best thing to\ndo seemed to him for Hermia to run away to his aunt's house at a place\nbeyond the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her and\nmarry her. But before she started, she told her friend, Helena, what she\nwas going to do.\n\nHelena had been Demetrius' sweetheart long before his marriage with\nHermia had been thought of, and being very silly, like all jealous\npeople, she could not see that it was not poor Hermia's fault that\nDemetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, Helena. She knew\nthat if she told Demetrius that Hermia was going, as she was, to the\nwood outside Athens, he would follow her, “and I can follow him, and\nat least I shall see him,” she said to herself. So she went to him, and\nbetrayed her friend's secret.\n\nNow this wood where Lysander was to meet Hermia, and where the other two\nhad decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, if\none only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were\nthe King and Queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania. Now fairies\nare very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as\nmortal folk. Oberon and Titania, who might have been as happy as the\ndays were long, had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel. They\nnever met without saying disagreeable things to each other, and scolded\neach other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, for\nfear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.\n\nSo, instead of keeping one happy Court and dancing all night through in\nthe moonlight as is fairies' use, the King with his attendants wandered\nthrough one part of the wood, while the Queen with hers kept state in\nanother. And the cause of all this trouble was a little Indian boy whom\nTitania had taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the child to\nfollow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the Queen would not give\nhim up.\n\nOn this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the King and Queen of the\nfairies met.\n\n“Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,” said the King.\n\n“What! jealous, Oberon?” answered the Queen. “You spoil everything with\nyour quarreling. Come, fairies, let us leave him. I am not friends with\nhim now.”\n\n“It rests with you to make up the quarrel,” said the King.\n\n“Give me that little Indian boy, and I will again be your humble servant\nand suitor.”\n\n“Set your mind at rest,” said the Queen. “Your whole fairy kingdom buys\nnot that boy from me. Come, fairies.”\n\nAnd she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.\n\n“Well, go your ways,” said Oberon. “But I'll be even with you before you\nleave this wood.”\n\nThen Oberon called his favorite fairy, Puck. Puck was the spirit of\nmischief. He used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and\nget into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer\nsour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at\nthem, and tumble people's stools from under them when they were going to\nsit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were going\nto drink.\n\n“Now,” said Oberon to this little sprite, “fetch me the flower called\nLove-in-idleness. The juice of that little purple flower laid on the\neyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love the\nfirst thing they see. I will put some of the juice of that flower on\nmy Titania's eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she\nsees, were it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or a\nbusy ape.”\n\nWhile Puck was gone, Demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor\nHelena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all\nhis promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love\nher, and that his promises were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor\nHelena, and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow\nDemetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love\nHelena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So\nPuck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but\nLysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw\nnot his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking\nfor the cruel Demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left\nhis own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.\n\nWhen Hermia woke she found Lysander gone, and wandered about the wood\ntrying to find him. Puck went back and told Oberon what he had done,\nand Oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about looking\nfor Demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.\nAnd the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke was also Helena. So now\nDemetrius and Lysander were both following her through the wood, and it\nwas Hermia's turn to follow her lover as Helena had done before. The\nend of it was that Helena and Hermia began to quarrel, and Demetrius and\nLysander went off to fight. Oberon was very sorry to see his kind scheme\nto help these lovers turn out so badly. So he said to Puck--\n\n“These two young men are going to fight. You must overhang the night\nwith drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find the\nother. When they are tired out, they will fall asleep. Then drop this\nother herb on Lysander's eyes. That will give him his old sight and his\nold love. Then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will\nall think that this has been only a Midsummer Night's Dream. Then when\nthis is done, all will be well with them.”\n\nSo Puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep\nwithout meeting each other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander's eyes,\nand said:--\n\n       “When thou wakest,\n        Thou takest\n        True delight\n        In the sight\n        Of thy former lady's eye:\n        Jack shall have Jill;\n        Nought shall go ill.”\n\nMeanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme,\noxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There\nTitania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin\nof a snake. Oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes,\nsaying:--\n\n       “What thou seest when thou wake,\n        Do it for thy true love take.”\n\nNow, it happened that when Titania woke the first thing she saw was a\nstupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood\nto rehearse their play. This clown had met with Puck, who had clapped\nan ass's head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.\nDirectly Titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, “What\nangel is this? Are you as wise as you are beautiful?”\n\n“If I am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that's enough for\nme,” said the foolish clown.\n\n“Do not desire to go out of the wood,” said Titania. The spell of the\nlove-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautiful\nand delightful creature on all the earth. “I love you,” she went on.\n“Come with me, and I will give you fairies to attend on you.”\n\nSo she called four fairies, whose names were Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,\nand Mustardseed.\n\n“You must attend this gentleman,” said the Queen. “Feed him with\napricots and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.\nSteal honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of\npainted butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.”\n\n“I will,” said one of the fairies, and all the others said, “I will.”\n\n“Now, sit down with me,” said the Queen to the clown, “and let me stroke\nyour dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and\nkiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.”\n\n“Where's Peaseblossom?” asked the clown with the ass's head. He did not\ncare much about the Queen's affection, but he was very proud of having\nfairies to wait on him."
var ShakespearePart4 = "“Ready,” said Peaseblossom.\n\n“Scratch my head, Peaseblossom,” said the clown. “Where's Cobweb?”\n “Ready,” said Cobweb.\n\n“Kill me,” said the clown, “the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistle\nyonder, and bring me the honey-bag. Where's Mustardseed?”\n\n“Ready,” said Mustardseed.\n\n“Oh, I want nothing,” said the clown. “Only just help Cobweb to scratch.\nI must go to the barber's, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the\nface.”\n\n“Would you like anything to eat?” said the fairy Queen.\n\n“I should like some good dry oats,” said the clown--for his donkey's\nhead made him desire donkey's food--“and some hay to follow.”\n\n“Shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel's house?”\n asked the Queen.\n\n“I'd rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,” said the clown.\n“But please don't let any of your people disturb me; I am going to\nsleep.”\n\nThen said the Queen, “And I will wind thee in my arms.”\n\nAnd so when Oberon came along he found his beautiful Queen lavishing\nkisses and endearments on a clown with a donkey's head.\n\nAnd before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to\ngive him the little Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he took\npity on her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on her\npretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed\nclown she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.\n\nOberon took off the ass's head from the clown, and left him to finish\nhis sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.\n\nThus all was made plain and straight again. Oberon and Titania loved\neach other more than ever. Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and\nHelena had never had any thought of anyone but Demetrius.\n\nAs for Hermia and Lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could\nmeet in a day's march, even through a fairy wood.\n\nSo the four mortal lovers went back to Athens and were married; and the\nfairy King and Queen live happily together in that very wood at this\nvery day.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TEMPEST\n\n\n\nProspero, the Duke of Milan, was a learned and studious man, who lived\namong his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his brother\nAntonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. But that trust was\nill-rewarded, for Antonio wanted to wear the duke's crown himself, and,\nto gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the\npeople bore him. However, with the help of Prospero's great enemy,\nAlonso, King of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom\nwith all its honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea,\nand when they were far away from land, forced him into a little boat\nwith no tackle, mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his\nlittle daughter, Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with\nhim, and sailed away, leaving them to their fate.\n\nBut one among the courtiers with Antonio was true to his rightful\nmaster, Prospero. To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but\nmuch could be done to remind him of a subject's love. So this worthy\nlord, whose name was Gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh\nwater, provisions, and clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all,\nsome of his precious books.\n\nThe boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed\nin safety. Now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under\nthe spell of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks\nof trees all the good spirits she found there. She died shortly before\nProspero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was\nthe chief, still remained in their prisons.\n\nProspero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost\nentirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed\nhis brother to manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the\nimprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were\nmore truly his subjects than his people in Milan had been. For he\ntreated them kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he exercised\nhis power over them wisely and well. One creature alone he found it\nnecessary to treat with harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the\nwicked old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to look on, and\nvicious and brutal in all his habits.\n\nWhen Miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it\nchanced that Antonio and Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and\nFerdinand, his son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their\nship came near Prospero's island. Prospero, knowing they were there,\nraised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave\nthemselves up for lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped\ninto the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. But\nAriel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although\nthey were washed overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of\nthe island, and the good ship herself, which they all thought had been\nwrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her. Such\nwonders could Prospero and his spirits perform.\n\nWhile yet the tempest was raging, Prospero showed his daughter the brave\nship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled\nwith living human beings like themselves. She, in pity of their lives,\nprayed him who had raised this storm to quell it. Then her father bade\nher to have no fear, for he intended to save every one of them.\n\nThen, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers,\nand that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies,\nAntonio and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his\nhands.\n\nWhen he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for\nAriel was at hand, and he had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed\nfor his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being\nthreateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when\nSycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the\nmaster who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and\npromised faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.\n\n“Do so,” said Prospero, “and in two days I will discharge thee.”\n\nThen he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search\nof the young prince. And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near\nhim, singing the while--\n\n   “Come unto these yellow sands\n      And then take hands:\n    Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd\n      (The wild waves whist),\n    Foot it featly here and there;\n    And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”\n\nAnd Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a\nsolemn air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his\neyes, for thus they ran--\n\n   “Full fathom five thy father lies;\n      Of his bones are coral made.\n    Those are pearls that were his eyes,\n      Nothing of him that doth fade,\n    But doth suffer a sea-change\n    Into something rich and strange.\n"
var ShakespearePart5 = "Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.\n    Hark! now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!”\n\nAnd so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of\nProspero and Miranda. Then, behold! all happened as Prospero desired.\nFor Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen\nany human being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with\nreverence in her eyes, and love in her secret heart.\n\n“I might call him,” she said, “a thing divine, for nothing natural I\never saw so noble!”\n\nAnd Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--\n\n“Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!”\n\nNor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for\nscarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to\nmake her his queen if she were willing. But Prospero, though secretly\ndelighted, pretended wrath.\n\n“You come here as a spy,” he said to Ferdinand. “I will manacle your\nneck and feet together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels,\nwithered roots and husk, and have sea-water to drink. Follow.”\n\n“No,” said Ferdinand, and drew his sword. But on the instant Prospero\ncharmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and\nMiranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. But he\nharshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell. There\nhe set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of\ntimber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his\ntoil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.\n\nShe in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would\nnot let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and\nshe, hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.\n\nThen Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he\ngave his consent to their marriage.\n\n“Take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”\n\nIn the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island\nwere plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand\nbeing dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on\nAlonso's death. And they would have carried out their wicked purpose\nwhile their victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.\n\nMany tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a banquet before them, and\njust as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder\nand lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet\ndisappeared. Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.\n\nProspero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his\ncell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly\nrepenting them of their sins.\n\nProspero determined to make one last use of his magic power, “And then,”\n said he, “I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound\nI'll drown my book.”\n\nSo he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in\nhis proper shape as the Duke of Milan.

His\nbrother went into the Forest of Arden, where he lived the life of a bold\nforester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.\n\nThe banished Duke's daughter, Rosalind, remained with Celia, Frederick's\ndaughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters. One day\nthere was a wrestling match at Court, and Rosalind and Celia went to see\nit. Charles, a celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many men\nin contests of this kind. Orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with,\nwas so slender and youthful, that Rosalind and Celia thought he would\nsurely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to him, and asked\nhim not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect of\ntheir words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter,\nso as to win praise from such sweet ladies.\n\nOrlando, like Rosalind's father, was being kept out of his inheritance\nby his brother, and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that, until\nhe saw Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. But now\nthe sight of the fair Rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that\nhe did marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the\nwrestler had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased\nwith his courage, and asked his name.\n\n“My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,”\n said the young man.\n\nNow Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to\nthe banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando\nwas, and would not befriend him. But Rosalind was delighted to hear that\nthis handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend, and\nas they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another\nkind word to the brave young man.\n\n“Gentleman,” she said, giving him a chain from her neck, “wear this for\nme. I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.”\n\nRosalind and Celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the\nhandsome wrestler, and Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first\nsight.\n\n“Come, come,” said Celia, “wrestle with thy affections.”\n\n“Oh,” answered Rosalind, “they take the part of a better wrestler than\nmyself. Look, here comes the Duke.”\n\n“With his eyes full of anger,” said Celia.\n\n“You must leave the Court at once,” he said to Rosalind. “Why?” she\nasked.\n\n“Never mind why,” answered the Duke, “you are banished. If within ten\ndays you are found within twenty miles of my Court, you die.”\n\nSo Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest\nof Arden. Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was\nrather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as\na young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said\nthat she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena."
var ShakespearePart7 = "They were very\ntired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were\nsitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede\nasked him if he could get them food. He did so, and told them that\na shepherd's flocks and house were to be sold. They bought these and\nsettled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.\n\nIn the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's\nlife, Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the\nrightful Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando\ncould think of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest\ncarving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on\nthe bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met\nthem, but he did not know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked\nthe pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her\nhe loved.\n\n“There is a foolish lover,” said Rosalind, “who haunts these woods and\nhangs sonnets on the trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him\nof his folly.”\n\nOrlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind said--“If\nyou will come and see me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I\nwill take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,\ntill I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.”\n\nAnd so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to\nher all the pretty things he would have said to Rosalind; and she had\nthe fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the\nright ears. Thus many days passed pleasantly away.\n\nOne morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he saw a man asleep\non the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for\nthe man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on\nanything that is dead or sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and\nsaw that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried to take his\nlife. He fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother's\nlife.\n\nWhile Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother,\nwhom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk\nof his own life. This made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged\nOrlando's pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. The\nlioness had wounded Orlando's arm so much, that he could not go on to\nsee the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.\n\nOliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena\nwas so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she\nfell in love with him at once. But when Ganymede heard of the danger\nOrlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said\ntruly enough, “I should have been a woman by right.”\n\nOliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, “I love\nAliena so well that I will give up my estates to you and marry her, and\nlive here as a shepherd.”\n\n“Let your wedding be to-morrow,” said Orlando, “and I will ask the Duke\nand his friends.”\n\nWhen Orlando told Ganymede how his brother was to be married on the\nmorrow, he added: “Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness\nthrough another man's eyes.”\n\nThen answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede's dress and speaking with his\nvoic--“If you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother\nmarries Aliena, shall you marry her.”\n\nNow the next day the Duke and his followers, and Orlando, and Oliver,\nand Aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.\n\nThen Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, “If I bring in your daughter\nRosalind, will you give her to Orlando here?” “That I would,” said the\nDuke, “if I had all kingdoms to give with her.”\n\n“And you say you will have her when I bring her?” she said to Orlando.\n“That would I,” he answered, “were I king of all kingdoms.”\n\nThen Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman's\nclothes again, and after a while came back.\n\nShe turned to her father--“I give myself to you, for I am yours.” “If\nthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my daughter.”\n\nThen she said to Orlando, “I give myself to you, for I am yours.” “If\nthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my Rosalind.”\n\n“I will have no father if you be not he,” she said to the Duke, and to\nOrlando, “I will have no husband if you be not he.”\n\nSo Orlando and Rosalind were married, and Oliver and Celia, and they\nlived happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For\nFrederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways,\nand so gave back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a\nmonastery to pray for forgiveness.\n\nThe wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A\nshepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she\nwas herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and\nall with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere\nwithin four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WINTER'S TALE\n\n\n\nLeontes was the King of Sicily, and his dearest friend was Polixenes,\nKing of Bohemia. They had been brought up together, and only separated\nwhen they reached man's estate and each had to go and rule over\nhis kingdom. After many years, when each was married and had a son,\n"
var ShakespearePart8 = "Polixenes came to stay with Leontes in Sicily.\n\nLeontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into\nhis stupid head that his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than\nshe did him, her own husband. When once he had got this into his head,\nnothing could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to\nput a poison in Polixenes' wine. Camillo tried to dissuade him from this\nwicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent.\nHe then told Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from\nthe Court of Sicily that night, and returned to Bohemia, where Camillo\nlived on as Polixenes' friend and counselor.\n\nLeontes threw the Queen into prison; and her son, the heir to the\nthrone, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly\ntreated.\n\nWhile the Queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend of\nhers, named Paulina, had the baby dressed in its best, and took it to\nshow the King, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughter\nwould soften his heart towards his dear Queen, who had never done him\nany wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; but the\nKing would not look at the baby, and ordered Paulina's husband to take\nit away in a ship, and leave it in the most desert and dreadful place\nhe could find, which Paulina's husband, very much against his will, was\nobliged to do.\n\nThen the poor Queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring\nPolixenes to her King; but really she had never thought of anyone except\nLeontes, her husband. Leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god,\nApollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the Queen. But\nhe had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened that\nthey arrived in the middle of the trial. The Oracle said--\n\n“Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject,\nLeontes a jealous tyrant, and the King shall live without an heir, if\nthat which is lost be not found.”\n\nThen a man came and told them that the little Prince was dead. The\npoor Queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the King saw how\nwicked and wrong he had been. He ordered Paulina and the ladies who were\nwith the Queen to take her away, and try to restore her. But Paulina\ncame back in a few moments, and told the King that Hermione was dead.\n\nNow Leontes' eyes were at last opened to his folly. His Queen was dead,\nand the little daughter who might have been a comfort to him he had sent\naway to be the prey of wolves and kites. Life had nothing left for him\nnow. He gave himself up to his grief, and passed in any sad years in\nprayer and remorse.\n\nThe baby Princess was left on the seacoast of Bohemia, the very kingdom\nwhere Polixenes reigned. Paulina's husband never went home to tell\nLeontes where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to the\nship, he met a bear and was torn to pieces. So there was an end of him.\n\nBut the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. She was\nrichly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to\nher cloak, saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came of noble\nparents.\n\nThe shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to\nhis wife, and they brought it up as their own child. She had no more\nteaching than a shepherd's child generally has, but she inherited from\nher royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different\nfrom the other maidens in the village where she lived.\n\nOne day Prince Florizel, the son of the good King of Bohemia, was\nbunting near the shepherd's house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a\ncharming woman. He made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that\nhe was the Prince, but saying that his name was Doricles, and that he\nwas a private gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the pretty\nPerdita, he came almost daily to see her.\n\nThe King could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every\nday from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that\nthe heir of the King of Bohemia was in love with Perdita, the pretty\nshepherd girl. Polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true,\ndisguised himself, and went with the faithful Camillo, in disguise\ntoo, to the old shepherd's house. They arrived at the feast of\nsheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were made very welcome.\nThere was dancing going on, and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces\nand gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.\n\nFlorizel and Perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene,\nbut sat quietly together talking. The King noticed the charming manners\nand great beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of\nhis old friend, Leontes. He said to Camillo--\n\n“This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green\nsward. Nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than\nherself--too noble for this place.”\n\nAnd Camillo answered, “In truth she is the Queen of curds and cream.”\n\nBut when Florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the\nstrangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King\nmade himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw\nFlorizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and\nwith that he left them. But Camillo remained behind, for he was charmed\nwith Perdita, and wished to befriend her.\n\nCamillo had long known how sorry Leontes was for that foolish madness of\nhis, and he longed to go back to Sicily to see his old master. He now\nproposed that the young people should go there and claim the protection\nof Leontes. So they went, and the shepherd went with them, taking\nPerdita's jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned to\nher cloak.\n\nLeontes received them with great kindness. He was very polite to Prince\nFlorizel, but all his looks were for Perdita. He saw how much she was\nlike the Queen Hermione, and said again and again--\n\n“Such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if I had not cruelly\nsent her from me.”\n\nWhen the old shepherd heard that the King had lost a baby daughter, who\nhad been left upon the coast of Bohemia, he felt sure that Perdita, the\nchild he had reared, must be the King's daughter, and when he told\nhis tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the King perceived that\nPerdita was indeed his long-lost child. He welcomed her with joy, and\nrewarded the good shepherd.\n\nPolixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with\nPerdita, but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend,\nhe was only too glad to give his consent.\n\nYet Leontes could not be happy. He remembered how his fair Queen,\nwho should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter's\nhappiness, was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing for\na long time but--\n\n“Oh, thy mother! thy mother!” and ask forgiveness of the King of\nBohemia, and then kiss his daughter again, and then the Prince Florizel,\nand then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.\n\nThen Paulina, who had been high all these years in the King's favor,\nbecause of her kindness to the dead Queen Hermione, said--“I have a\nstatue made in the likeness of the dead Queen, a piece many years in\ndoing, and performed by the rare Italian master, Giulio Romano. I keep\nit in a private house apart, and there, ever since you lost your Queen,\nI have gone twice or thrice a day. Will it please your Majesty to go and\nsee the statue?”\n\nSo Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and Perdita, with Camillo and\ntheir attendants, went to Paulina's house where there was a heavy purple\ncurtain screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her hand on the\ncurtain, said--\n\n“She was peerless when she was alive, and I do believe that her dead\nlikeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand\nof man hath done. Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it\nis--behold, and say, 'tis well.”\n\nAnd with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. The\nKing gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said\nnothing.\n\n“I like your silence,” said Paulina; “it the more shows off your wonder.\nBut speak, is it not like her?”\n\n“It is almost herself,” said the King, “and yet, Paulina, Hermione was\nnot so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.”\n\n“Oh, not by much,” said Polixenes.\n\n“Al,” said Paulina,"
var ShakespearePart9 = "“that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows her\nto us as she would have been had she lived till now.”\n\nAnd still Leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.\n\n“If I had known,” said Paulina, “that this poor image would so have\nstirred your grief, and love, I would not have shown it to you.”\n\nBut he only answered, “Do not draw the curtain.”\n\n“No, you must not look any longer,” said Paulina, “or you will think it\nmoves.”\n\n“Let be! let be!” said the King. “Would you not think it breathed?”\n\n“I will draw the curtain,” said Paulina; “you will think it lives\npresently.”\n\n“Ah, sweet Paulina,” said Leontes, “make me to think so twenty years\ntogether.”\n\n“If you can bear it,” said Paulina, “I can make the statue move, make\nit come down and take you by the hand. Only you would think it was by\nwicked magic.”\n\n“Whatever you can make her do, I am content to look on,” said the King.\n\nAnd then, all folks there admiring and beholding, the statue moved from\nits pedestal, and came down the steps and put its arms round the King's\nneck, and he held her face and kissed her many times, for this was\nno statue, but the real living Queen Hermione herself. She had lived\nhidden, by Paulina's kindness, all these years, and would not discover\nherself to her husband, though she knew he had repented, because she\ncould not quite forgive him till she knew what had become of her little\nbaby.\n\nNow that Perdita was found, she forgave her husband everything, and it\nwas like a new and beautiful marriage to them, to be together once more.\n\nFlorizel and Perdita were married and lived long and happily.\n\nTo Leontes his many years of suffering were well paid for in the moment\nwhen, after long grief and pain, he felt the arms of his true love\naround him once again.\n\n\n\n\nKING LEAR\n\n\n\nKing Lear was old and tired. He was aweary of the business of his\nkingdom, and wished only to end his days quietly near his three\ndaughters. Two of his daughters were married to the Dukes of Albany\nand Cornwall; and the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France were both\nsuitors for the hand of Cordelia, his youngest daughter.\n\nLear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposed\nto divide his kingdom between them. “But first,” said he, “I should like\nto know much you love me.”\n\nGoneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her father\nat all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved him\ndearer than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health,\nbeauty, and honor.\n\n“I love you as much as my sister and more,” professed Regan, “since I\ncare for nothing but my father's love.”\n\nLear was very much pleased with Regan's professions, and turned to his\nyoungest daughter, Cordelia. “Now, our joy, though last not least,” he\nsaid, “the best part of my kingdom have I kept for you. What can you\nsay?”\n\n“Nothing, my lord,” answered Cordelia.\n\n“Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again,” said the King.\n\nAnd Cordelia answered, “I love your Majesty according to my duty--no\nmore, no less.”\n\nAnd this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which her\nsisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense of\nduty to their old father.\n\n“I am your daughter,” she went on, “and you have brought me up and loved\nme, and I return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you,\nlove you, and most honor you.”\n\nLear, who loved Cordelia best, had wished her to make more extravagant\nprofessions of love than her sisters. “Go,” he said, “be for ever a\nstranger to my heart and me.”\n\nThe Earl of Kent, one of Lear's favorite courtiers and captains, tried\nto say a word for Cordelia's sake, but Lear would not listen. He divided\nthe kingdom between Goneril and Regan, and told them that he should only\nkeep a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters by\nturns.\n\nWhen the Duke of Burgundy knew that Cordelia would have no share of the\nkingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. But the King of France was\nwiser, and said, “Thy dowerless daughter, King, is Queen of us--of ours,\nand our fair France.”\n\n“Take her, take her,” said the King; “for I will never see that face of\nhers again.”\n\nSo Cordelia became Queen of France, and the Earl of Kent, for having\nventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. The King now\nwent to stay with his daughter Goneril, who had got everything from her\nfather that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundred\nknights that he had reserved for himself. She was harsh and undutiful\nto him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretended\nthat they did not hear them.\n\nNow the Earl of Kent, when he was banished, made as though he would\ngo into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise of\na servingman and took service with the King. The King had now two\nfriends--the Earl of Kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and his\nFool, who was faithful to him. Goneril told her father plainly that his\nknights only served to fill her Court with riot and feasting; and so she\nbegged him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.\n\n“My train are men who know all parts of duty,” said Lear. “Goneril, I\nwill not trouble you further--yet I have left another daughter.”\n\nAnd his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for the\ncastle of Regan. But she, who had formerly outdone her sister in\nprofessions of attachment to the King, now seemed to outdo her in\nundutiful conduct, saying that fifty knights were too many to wait on\nhim, and Goneril (who had hurried thither to prevent Regan showing any\nkindness to the old King) said five were too many, since her servants\ncould wait on him.\n\nThen when Lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away,\nhe left them. It was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about the\nheath half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor Fool.\nBut presently his servant, the good Earl of Kent, met him, and at last\npersuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. At daybreak the\nEarl of Kent removed his royal master to Dover, and hurried to the Court\nof France to tell Cordelia what had happened.\n\nCordelia's husband gave her an army and with it she landed at Dover.\nHere she found poor King Lear, wandering about the fields, wearing a\ncrown of nettles and weeds. They brought him back and fed and clothed\nhim, and Cordelia came to him and kissed him.\n\n“You must bear with me,” said Lear;"
var ShakespearePart10 = "“forget and forgive. I am old and\nfoolish.”\n\nAnd now he knew at last which of his children it was that had loved him\nbest, and who was worthy of his love.\n\nGoneril and Regan joined their armies to fight Cordelia's army, and were\nsuccessful; and Cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. Then\nGoneril's husband, the Duke of Albany, who was a good man, and had not\nknown how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; and\nwhen Goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman she\nwas, she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadly\npoison to her sister, Regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.\n\nBut they had arranged that Cordelia should be hanged in prison, and\nthough the Duke of Albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. The\nold King came staggering into the tent of the Duke of Albany, carrying\nthe body of his dear daughter Cordelia, in his arms.\n\nAnd soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell with\nher still in his arms, and died.\n\n\n\n\nTWELFTH NIGHT\n\n\n\nOrsino, the Duke of Illyria, was deeply in love with a beautiful\nCountess named Olivia. Yet was all his love in vain, for she disdained\nhis suit; and when her brother died, she sent back a messenger from the\nDuke, bidding him tell his master that for seven years she would not\nlet the very air behold her face, but that, like a nun, she would walk\nveiled; and all this for the sake of a dead brother's love, which she\nwould keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance.\n\nThe Duke longed for someone to whom he could tell his sorrow, and repeat\nover and over again the story of his love. And chance brought him such a\ncompanion. For about this time a goodly ship was wrecked on the Illyrian\ncoast, and among those who reached land in safety were the captain and\na fair young maid, named Viola. But she was little grateful for being\nrescued from the perils of the sea, since she feared that her twin\nbrother was drowned, Sebastian, as dear to her as the heart in her\nbosom, and so like her that, but for the difference in their manner of\ndress, one could hardly be told from the other. The captain, for her\ncomfort, told her that he had seen her brother bind himself “to a strong\nmast that lived upon the sea,” and that thus there was hope that he\nmight be saved.\n\nViola now asked in whose country she was, and learning that the young\nDuke Orsino ruled there, and was as noble in his nature as in his name,\nshe decided to disguise herself in male attire, and seek for employment\nwith him as a page.\n\nIn this she succeeded, and now from day to day she had to listen to the\nstory of Orsino's love. At first she sympathized very truly with him,\nbut soon her sympathy grew to love. At last it occurred to Orsino that\nhis hopeless love-suit might prosper better if he sent this pretty lad\nto woo Olivia for him. Viola unwillingly went on this errand, but when\nshe came to the house, Malvolio, Olivia's steward, a vain, officious\nman, sick, as his mistress told him, of self-love, forbade the messenger\nadmittance.\n\nViola, however (who was now called Cesario), refused to take any denial,\nand vowed to have speech with the Countess. Olivia, hearing how her\ninstructions were defied and curious to see this daring youth, said,\n“We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.”\n\nWhen Viola was admitted to her presence and the servants had been sent\naway, she listened patiently to the reproaches which this bold messenger\nfrom the Duke poured upon her, and listening she fell in love with the\nsupposed Cesario; and when Cesario had gone, Olivia longed to send some\nlove-token after him. So, calling Malvolio, she bade him follow the boy.\n\n“He left this ring behind him,” she said, taking one from her finger.\n“Tell him I will none of it.”\n\nMalvolio did as he was bid, and then Viola, who of course knew perfectly\nwell that she had left no ring behind her, saw with a woman's quickness\nthat Olivia loved her. Then she went back to the Duke, very sad at heart\nfor her lover, and for Olivia, and for herself.\n\nIt was but cold comfort she could give Orsino, who now sought to ease\nthe pangs of despised love by listening to sweet music, while Cesario\nstood by his side.\n\n“Ah,” said the Duke to his page that night, “you too have been in love.”\n\n“A little,” answered Viola.\n\n“What kind of woman is it?” he asked.\n\n“Of your complexion,” she answered.\n\n“What years, i' faith?” was his next question.\n\nTo this came the pretty answer, “About your years, my lord.”\n\n“Too old, by Heaven!” cried the Duke. “Let still the woman take an elder\nthan herself.”\n\nAnd Viola very meekly said, “I think it well, my lord.”\n\nBy and by Orsino begged Cesario once more to visit Olivia and to plead\nhis love-suit. But she, thinking to dissuade him, said--\n\n“If some lady loved you as you love Olivia?”\n\n“Ah! that cannot be,” said the Duke.\n\n“But I know,” Viola went on, “what love woman may have for a man. My\nfather had a daughter loved a man, as it might be,” she added blushing,\n“perhaps, were I a woman, I should love your lordship.”\n\n“And what is her history?” he asked.\n\n“A blank, my lord,” Viola answered. “She never told her love, but let\nconcealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek: she\npined in thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat, like\nPatience on a monument, smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?”\n\n“But died thy sister of her love, my boy?” the Duke asked; and Viola,\nwho had all the time been telling her own love for him in this pretty\nfashion, said--\n\n“I am all the daughters my father has and all the brothers-- Sir, shall\nI go to the lady?”\n\n“To her in haste,” said the Duke, at once forgetting all about the\nstory, “and give her this jewel.”\n\nSo Viola went, and this time poor Olivia was unable to hide her love,\nand openly confessed it with such passionate truth, that Viola left her\nhastily, saying--\n\n“Nevermore will I deplore my master's tears to you.”\n\nBut in vowing this, Viola did not know the tender pity she would feel\nfor other's suffering. So when Olivia, in the violence of her love,\nsent a messenger, praying Cesario to visit her once more, Cesario had no\nheart to refuse the request.\n\nBut the favors which Olivia bestowed upon this mere page aroused the\njealousy of Sir Andrew Aguecheek, a foolish, rejected lover of hers, who\nat that time was staying at her house with her merry old uncle Sir Toby.\nThis same Sir Toby dearly loved a practical joke, and knowing Sir Andrew\nto be an arrant coward, he thought that if he could bring off a duel\nbetween him and Cesario, there would be rare sport indeed. So he induced\nSir Andrew to send a challenge, which he himself took to Cesario. The\npoor page, in great terror, said--\n\n“I will return again to the house, I am no fighter.”\n\n“Back you shall not to the house,” said Sir Toby, “unless you fight me\nfirst.”\n\nAnd as he looked a very fierce old gentleman, Viola thought it best to\nawait Sir Andrew's coming; and when he at last made his appearance, in\na great fright, if the truth had been known, she tremblingly drew her\nsword, and Sir Andrew in like fear followed her example. Happily for\nthem both, at this moment some officers of the Court came on the scene,\nand stopped the intended duel. Viola gladly made off with what speed she\nmight, while Sir Toby called after her--\n\n“A very paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare!”\n\nNow, while these things were happening, Sebastian had escaped all\nthe dangers of the deep, and had landed safely in Illyria, where he\ndetermined to make his way to the Duke's Court. On his way thither he\npassed Olivia's house just as Viola had left it in such a hurry, and\nwhom should he meet but Sir Andrew and Sir Toby. Sir Andrew, mistaking\nSebastian for the cowardly Cesario, took his courage in both hands, and\nwalking up to him struck him, saying, “There's for you.”\n\n“Why, there's for you; and there, and there!” said Sebastian, bitting\nback a great deal harder, and again and again, till Sir Toby came to\nthe rescue of his friend. Sebastian, however, tore himself free from Sir\nToby's clutches, and drawing his sword would have fought them both, but\nthat Olivia herself, having heard of the quarrel, came running in, and\nwith many reproaches sent Sir Toby and his friend away. Then turning\nto Sebastian, whom she too thought to be Cesario, she besought him with\nmany a pretty speech to come into the house with her.\n\nSebastian, half dazed and all delighted with her beauty and grace,\nreadily consented, and that very day, so great was Olivia's baste,\nthey were married before she had discovered that he was not Cesario, or\nSebastian was quite certain whether or not he was in a dream.\n\nMeanwhile Orsino, hearing how ill Cesario sped with Olivia, visited her\nhimself, taking Cesario with him. Olivia met them both before her\ndoor, and seeing, as she thought, her husband there, reproached him for\nleaving her, while to the Duke she said that his suit was as fat and\nwholesome to her as howling after music.\n\n“Still so cruel?” said Orsino.\n\n“Still so constant,” she answered.\n\nThen Orsino's anger growing to cruelty, he vowed that, to be revenged on\nher, he would kill Cesario, whom he knew she loved. “Come, boy,” he said\nto the page.\n\nAnd Viola, following him as he moved away, said, “I, to do you rest, a\nthousand deaths would die.”\n\nA great fear took hold on Olivia, and she cried aloud, “Cesario,\nhusband, stay!”\n\n“Her husband?” asked the Duke angrily.\n\n“No, my lord, not I,” said Viola.\n\n“Call forth the holy father,” cried Olivia.\n\nAnd the priest who had married Sebastian and Olivia, coming in, declared\nCesario to be the bridegroom.\n\n“O thou dissembling cub!” the Duke exclaimed. “Farewell, and take her,\nbut go where thou and I henceforth may never meet.”\n\nAt this moment Sir Andrew came up with bleeding crown, complaining that\nCesario had broken his head, and Sir Toby's as well.\n\n“I never hurt you,” said Viola, very positively; “you drew your sword on\nme, but I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.”\n\nYet, for all her protesting, no one there believed her; but all their\nthoughts were on a sudden changed to wonder, when Sebastian came in.\n\n“I am sorry, madam,” he said to his wife, “I have hurt your kinsman.\nPardon me, sweet, even for the vows we made each other so late ago.”\n\n“One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!” cried the Duke,\nlooking first at Viola, and then at Sebastian.\n\n“An apple cleft in two,” said one who knew Sebastian, “is not more twin\nthan these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?”\n\n“I never had a brother,” said Sebastian. “I had a sister, whom the blind\nwaves and surges have devoured.” “Were you a woman,” he said to Viola,\n“I should let my tears fall upon your cheek, and say, 'Thrice welcome,\ndrowned Viola!'”\n\nThen Viola, rejoicing to see her dear brother alive, confessed that she\nwas indeed his sister, Viola. As she spoke, Orsino felt the pity that is\nakin to love.\n\n“Boy,” he said, “thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never\nshouldst love woman like to me.”\n\n“And all those sayings will I overswear,” Viola replied, “and all those\nswearings keep true.”\n\n“Give me thy hand,” Orsino cried in gladness. “Thou shalt be my wife,\nand my fancy's queen.”\n\nThus was the gentle Viola made happy, while Olivia found in Sebastian\na constant lover, and a good husband, and he in her a true and loving\nwife.\n\n\n\n\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING\n\n\n\nIn Sicily is a town called Messina, which is the scene of a curious\nstorm in a teacup that raged several hundred years ago.\n\nIt began with sunshine. Don Pedro, Prince of Arragon, in Spain, had\ngained so complete a victory over his foes that the very land whence\nthey came is forgotten. Feeling happy and playful after the fatigues of\nwar, Don Pedro came for a holiday to Messina, and in his suite were his\nstepbrother Don John and two young Italian lords, Benedick and Claudio.\n\nBenedick was a merry chatterbox, who had determined to live a bachelor.\nClaudio, on the other hand, no sooner arrived at Messina than he fell in\nlove with Hero, the daughter of Leonato, Governor of Messina.\n\nOne July day, a perfumer called Borachio was burning dried lavender in\na musty room in Leonato's house, when the sound of conversation floated\nthrough the open window.\n\n“Give me your candid opinion of Hero,” Claudio, asked, and Borachio\nsettled himself for comfortable listening.\n\n“Too short and brown for praise,” was Benedick's reply; “but alter her\ncolor or height, and you spoil her.”\n\n“In my eyes she is the sweetest of women,” said Claudio.\n\n“Not in mine,” retorted Benedick, “and I have no need for glasses. She\nis like the last day of December compared with the first of May if you\nset her beside her cousin. Unfortunately, the Lady Beatrice is a fury.”\n\nBeatrice was Leonato's niece. She amused herself by saying witty and\nsevere things about Benedick, who called her Dear Lady Disdain. She\nwas wont to say that she was born under a dancing star, and could not\ntherefore be dull.\n\nClaudio and Benedick were still talking when Don Pedro came up and said\ngood-humoredly, “Well, gentlemen, what's the secret?”\n\n“I am longing,” answered Benedick, “for your Grace to command me to\ntell.”\n\n“I charge you, then, on your allegiance to tell me,” said Don Pedro,\nfalling in with his humor.\n\n“I can be as dumb as a mute,” apologized Benedick to Claudio, “but his\nGrace commands my speech.” To Don Pedro he said, “Claudio is in love\nwith Hero, Leonato's short daughter.”\n\nDon Pedro was pleased, for he admired Hero and was fond of Claudio. When\nBenedick had departed, he said to Claudio, “Be steadfast in your love\nfor Hero, and I will help you to win her. To-night her father gives a\nmasquerade, and I will pretend I am Claudio, and tell her how Claudio\nloves her, and if she be pleased, I will go to her father and ask his\nconsent to your union.”\n\nMost men like to do their own wooing, but if you fall in love with a\nGovernor's only daughter, you are fortunate if you can trust a prince to\nplead for you.\n\nClaudio then was fortunate, but he was unfortunate as well, for he\nhad an enemy who was outwardly a friend. This enemy was Don Pedro's\nstepbrother Don John, who was jealous of Claudio because Don Pedro\npreferred him to Don John.\n\nIt was to Don John that Borachio came with the interesting conversation\nwhich he had overheard.\n\n“I shall have some fun at that masquerade myself,” said Don John when\nBorachio ceased speaking.\n\nOn the night of the masquerade, Don Pedro, masked and pretending he was\nClaudio, asked Hero if he might walk with her.\n\nThey moved away together, and Don John went up to Claudio and said,\n“Signor Benedick, I believe?” “The same,” fibbed Claudio.\n\n“I should be much obliged then,” said Don John, “if you would use your\ninfluence with my brother to cure him of his love for Hero. She is\nbeneath him in rank.”\n\n“How do you know he loves her?” inquired Claudio.\n\n“I heard him swear his affection,” was the reply, and Borachio chimed in\nwith, “So did I too.”\n\nClaudio was then left to himself, and his thought was that his Prince\nhad betrayed him. “Farewell, Hero,” he muttered; “I was a fool to trust\nto an agent.”\n\nMeanwhile Beatrice and Benedick (who was masked) were having a brisk\nexchange of opinions.\n\n“Did Benedick ever make you laugh?” asked she.\n\n“Who is Benedick?” he inquired.\n\n“A Prince's jester,” replied Beatrice, and she spoke so sharply that “I\nwould not marry her,” he declared afterwards, “if her estate were the\nGarden of Eden.”\n\nBut the principal speaker at the masquerade was neither Beatrice nor\nBenedick. It was Don Pedro, who carried out his plan to the letter"
